# Nulogy Deployer

## Contributing

We treat this project as an internal "open source" project. Everyone at Nulogy is welcome to submit Merge Requests.

### Testing local terraform changes

1. Create a symbolic link from one of your apps to deployer/app_source. For example:

    ln -s ~/src/go/infrastructure/terraform deployer/apps_source/go

1. Run nulogy-deployer container:

```
./develop_deployer.sh <docker-image-used-for-testing-deployments>
```

1. Change into the app directory you linked above. For example:

```
cd apps/go
```

**NOTE: Never run `tg.sh apply` on any production environment since it will change the terraform state. If you want to see changes your new code will make, run `tg.sh plan`**
